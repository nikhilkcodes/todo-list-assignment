<h1>Description</h1>
This project is a simple To-Do List web application with a Dark Mode feature. It allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks easily. The Dark Mode feature provides a visually appealing and comfortable experience, especially in low-light environments.
<h1>Features</h1>
Create, edit, and delete tasks.
Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
Dark Mode for improved visibility and reduced eye strain in low-light conditions.
Responsive design for seamless usage on both desktop and mobile devices.
<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ol>
  <li>TypeScript: The project is built using TypeScript for a statically typed and more maintainable codebase.</li>
  <li>Express.js: The backend server is powered by Express.js, a popular Node.js framework, to handle HTTP requests.</li>
  <li>EJS (Embedded JavaScript): EJS templates are used for rendering dynamic content on the frontend.</li>
  <li>Body Parser: The Body Parser middleware is used for parsing incoming request bodies in JSON and URL-encoded formats.</li>
  <li>MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage application data.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Installation</h1>
To run this project locally, you'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository: </li> `https://github.com/nikhilkcodes/To-Do-App-Mongodb-Ts.git`
  <li> Navigate to the project directory: </li> `cd To-Do-App-Mongodb-Ts`
  <li>Build the TypeScript code to JavaScript:</li>  `npm run build`
  <li>Change to the `dist` directory where the JavaScript files are stored: </li>  `npm run build`
  <li>Install the required Node.js modules: </li>`npm i`
  <li> Start the application: </li> `npm start`
</ol>
This will start the server, and you can access the application in your web browser. Ensure that your MongoDB database address is correctly configured in your project's code to match your application's address.
With these changes, your README file now includes the steps to build the TypeScript code to JavaScript and properly set up the project.
